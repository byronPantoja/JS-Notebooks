# JS Notebooks

_It's Jupyter Notebooks for JS!_

I need something fresh to keep me engaged. Plus what really got me back into loving to _LEARN_ to program was being able to see what the code does and take notes in the same app. I actually found this course because I was looking for the JS equivalent to Jupiter Notebooks.

I've updated my 2020 goals dozens of times since January, and twice just today. I was trying to refresh my JS learnings so I could tackle this course, but I'm just getting bored. A part of me doesn't want to build or learn something that doesn't interest me. And since I'm in a position where I'm already working on ecommerce sites for clients (basic ones for SME's), I don't feel that pressure anymore to learn something that will get me '_hired_'.

I guess this is the first big project from a tutorial that I just **want** to learn. So why postpone it.
